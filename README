Coding Conventions
==================

* **Please use tabs for indentation!**
	+ I prefer tabs to spaces in C, Java, and other similar languages for the
	following reason:
		- My tabstop and shiftwidth are set to 2 spaces. If you prefer something
		else, it is trivial to adjust this: simply change the size of your tab
		character.
	+ Alternatively, we can mix and match tabs and spaces. :(
* I have no qualms on how you wrap single-line if/else statements, loops, etc.
	Just please be consistent, if you wouldn't mind.
* Don't overcomment, but if you write something and its meaning isn't immediately
	obvious, please put some comments above/beside it.
